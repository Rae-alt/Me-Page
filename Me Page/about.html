    <h3>A Day In the Life</h3>

    <p>A typical weekday for me looks like getting up around 4 AM to workout. 
        Right now I like to do weights and then walk for about 30 minutes. I 
        then head to the kitchen to take my vitamins and supplements. After 
        that I get dressed for I.C.Stars. I've really been enjoying exploring 
        fashion and developing my personal style, so that makes getting 
        dressed everyday more fun for me. Once dressed I make sure that I 
        have everything packed like my supplies and lunch before I make the 
        30- 45 min commute to the office. I like to give myself a lot of time 
        in the morning because I like to take my time. During the workday I 
        am always learning something new, and that's what I like most about 
        the program. The staff keeps us very busy which is great! Our day is 
        over by 7:30 PM and if I haven't driven myself, my fiance comes to pick
         me up. I like when we commute together because we're always busy doing 
         our own things, so it's nice that we have a little time together in the morning and afternoon. By the time I get home I am 
         exhaused. Sometimes I do a little studying but most of the time I go 
         straight to bed.

    </p>

    <h3>Challenges I have Overcome</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Mental Health</li>
        <li>Stagnation</li>
        <li>Life Changes</li>
        <li>Fear</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        I overcame periods of stagnation and fear by prioritizing my mental health and embracing life changes 
        with a positive mindset. I realized that taking care of my mental well-being was crucial to breaking 
        through obstacles and growing. Through practices like mindfullness, therapy, and setting 
        healthy boundries, I learned to manage stress and stay grounded during challenging times. This journey 
        not only helped me build resilience but also gave me the confidence to pursue new opportunities and tackle 
        fears head on.
    </p>

    <h3>My Dream Job </h3>
        <p>I'm passionate about cybersecurity and penetration testing because those roles would allow me to
            combine problem-solving, technical skills, and a deep interest in protecting organizations from 
            cyber threats. I thrive in environments where I can continuously learn and adapt, and these roles 
            provide that constant challenge. Work-life balance is also important to me, and I'd love a postion 
            that offers flexibility, such as a hybrid work-model. I'm also eager to find a role that supports my 
            personal growth, like through tuition reimbursement and/ or professinal development opportunities. I 
            value the chance to travel and contribute to both my community and the tech field, so having time to 
            pursue personal intrests and give back is key to my ideal work environment.

        </p>

    <h3>Inspirational Figures </h3>
        <p>

            I draw a lot of inspiration from my family and friends because they really stand out in what they do. 
            Whether it's their work ethic, creativity, or the kindness they show to others, I'm constantly amazed 
            by how much they give to the world. They balance their careers and personal lives in such an inspiring 
            way, and they always push me to do better. Their integrity and dedication to what matters most have 
            really helped shape the vision I have for my own life.
        </p>


    <h3>What I want most out of the I.C.stars program is...</h3>

        <p>
            To be challenged and pushed outside my comfort zone, and at this point I know that's what I'm getting. 
            I'm ready for the growth and skills I gain, and I can already tell that by the end, I'll be so proud of what 
            I've acomplished. I really hope I can spread the word about this program so that more people get the 
            chance to be apart of something this rewarding.

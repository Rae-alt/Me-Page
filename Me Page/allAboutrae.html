    <p>
        My name is Rae and I am 29 years old. I am an intern at I.C.Stars,
        cycle 3, in Kansas City, Missouri. I was born in San Diego, California but 
        raised here in Kansas City. I have worked in medical billing for about 7
        years. Currently I work PRN and intern at I.C.stars.

        <br>
        <br>
        As an I.C.Stars intern I am learing a lot! I can tell that I'm right where 
        I need to be, growing more each day. In the future I hope to use the skills 
        I have aquired to gain tech certifications like Security+, RHCSA, & CompTIA
        so that I am credentialed. I am also looking forward to furthering my 
        education at the university level.
